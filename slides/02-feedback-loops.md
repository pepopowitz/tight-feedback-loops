## Feedback Loops

### What is a feedback loop?

```
----action---->
<---effect----
```

Definition: blah blah blah you put an action in, see the effect, and keep doing that.


### Examples

Thermostat

---

The thermostat checks the room temperature.

If it is below the desired temperature, it tells the furnace/boiler to warm it up

The thermostat checks the temperature again, and the loop continues

Until the temperature is at 67 degrees, when it tells the furnace/boiler to stop


...

But not all feedback loops are equal. 

#### Bad feedback loop

Sending my bike to the shop to get it tuned up

I don't see the results of this for days. 
And when I get it back, i find that it still doesn't shift, so I have to send it back again.

#### Better feedback loop
Walking to my neighbors house to borrow his screwdriver to tune my bike
Walking home, and testing it there.

Here, I see the results of each tuning in a much shorter time.

But I still have to walk to my neighbors house each cycle through the loop. 

#### Best feedback loop
Keeping a screwdriver in my garage, to tune my bike.
Now, I get to see the results of each tuning almost instantly.


### So How do I get better feedback?
A: By tightening the loop.

The tighter the loop, the quicker the feedback/your ability to react

These means making the arrows in the drawing shorter.


### Demo

? Can we come up with an activity to demonstrate the difficulty with a large feedback loop?
