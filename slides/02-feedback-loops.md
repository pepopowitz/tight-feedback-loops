## Feedback Loops
### What is a feedback loop?
### Why do we want it tightened?
### Examples

* Good: NCrunch
* Okay: derailleur on a bike
* Bad: Compiling mainframe code at State Farm (sending over to another department)

? Can we come up with an activity to demonstrate the difficulty with a large feedback loop?
