## Feedback Loops

### What is a feedback loop?

```
----action---->
<---effect----
```

???
Definition: blah blah blah you put an action in, see the effect, and keep doing that.

---

### Examples

Thermostat

???

The thermostat checks the room temperature.

If it is below the desired temperature, it tells the furnace/boiler to warm it up

The thermostat checks the temperature again, and the loop continues

Until the temperature is at 67 degrees, when it tells the furnace/boiler to stop

...

But not all feedback loops are equal.

### The bike tuning feedback loop

```
ride ----> 
<-----tune
```

???

I am a bike guy. 

When your bike starts clicking when you pedal, it often means you need to adjust your derailleurs.

???

That's a derailleur.

### The bike tuning feedback loop

```
ride ----> 
<-----tune
```

???

Anyway, adjusting your derailleurs involves a feedback loop. 

You turn a screw a quarter turn, and then you ride the bike to see if you fixed it.

This is what that feedback loop likes like.

#### Bad

```
----- ride ----------->v 
^                      v
^                      v
^<-----tune------------- (at the bike shop)
```

???

Here's a way to make that feedback loop awful.

The problem is, I don't see the results of this for days.

And if I get it back and find that it still doesn't shift well, I have to take it back to the shop again.

This is a loose, slow, yucky feedback loop.

---

#### Better

```
----- ride ----->v 
^                v
^<-----tune------- (at my neighbor's house)
```

???

We can make this a little better.

It turns out my neighbor knows bikes, and he knows which screw to turn 1/4 turn. 

Here, I see the results of each tuning in a much shorter time.

But I still have to walk to my neighbors house each cycle through the loop. 

---

#### Best!

```
ride ----> 
<-----tune (in my garage)
```

???

But we can make this even better!

I can learn a new skill - in this case, bike repair

And now, I get to see the results of each tuning almost instantly!

---

### So How do I get better feedback?

A: By tightening the loop.

---

The tighter the loop, the quicker the feedback/your ability to react

These means making the arrows in the drawing shorter,

or making each stop along the way take less time.

In my bike example, it meant eliminating trips to the bike shop or neighbors house.

### The Developer-QE feedback loop

```
^code ----> build ---> deploy ---v
^<---- changes <---- test <-------v
```

---

So here's a feedback loop we experience.

This is the loop between developers and QE's.

There are a lot of stops along that loop.

A lot of opportunities for that loop to get bigger, and slower.

Tyler and I want to help you make that loop smaller, instead.
