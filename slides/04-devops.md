## DevOps

### What is it?
* The Three Ways (Gene Kim)
** Flow <--- we skipped this, now we're gonna talk about it a bit more
** Feedback <--- you are here
** Continuous Improvement <--- this is what you're gonna bring home after today
(Draw picture, basically this: http://itrevolution.com/the-three-ways-principles-underpinning-devops/)

### So what is it really?
* Closer collaboration
* Chocolatey automation goodness
* Quicker feedback
* Easier/better decisions for the business

### What does this do for us?
* No more all-nighter deployments
* Ability to run experiments and make small, rapid improvements
* Tighter feedback loops - how do each of these help?
** QA <--> Coders
** IT <--> Development
** Business <--> Development
** Company <--> Customers

### Demo
* Running CI
* Unit test results
* Automated deployments for further testing
