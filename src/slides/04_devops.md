## What is it?

- Flow                   <--- we skipped this, now we're gonna talk about it a bit more
- Feedback               <--- you are here
- Continuous Improvement <--- this is what you're gonna bring home after today

## So what is it _really_?

???
Collaboration
Faster feedback
Better business decisions

---

## What does this do for us?
No more all-nighter deployments
Ability to run experiments and make small, rapid improvements
Faster feedback loops

---

## The DevOps feedback loop

```
codez ----> build ---> deploy ---> test --v
^                                         v
^                                         v
<--- changes <--- reviews <--- deliver <--v
```

How is this different from before? We've taken away the shortcuts, and added *customers*

---

## Every software feature is an experiment until you've obtained feedback on it in production

???

Example: Intuit running turbotax experiments in production during tax season
We've made the loop much longer, but we still want it to be fast. Enter automation....
