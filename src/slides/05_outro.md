# How Do I Get Started?

???

How do I get started? 

---
## You're in a QA silo right now, how do you get closer to the dev team?
Make the argument to start officially aligning QA people with the dev teams they support in reality

Start providing test cases *ahead* of the development team's progress

---
## Are you in with the dev team, but all the testing is done after code-freeze/at the end of the sprint/next sprint?
Go talk to your developers - make yourself highly approachable, encourage questions and dialogue

Developers are sensitive crybabies - be gentle with the bug reports!

---
## How do I get all that slick automation goodness? 
Encourage developers to start creating automated tests, so the build server can actually do stuff

Go grab a CI server and play around
- TODO Links to free CI things

Bring this to your boss/PM/PO - talk about the potential gains in investing someone's time
