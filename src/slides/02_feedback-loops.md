# What is a feedback loop?

Definition: you make an action, observe the effect, and repeat.

# The Thermostat

The canonical example of a feedback loop is a thermostat.

# The Thermostat

The thermostat checks the room temperature.

If it is below the desired temperature, it tells the furnace/boiler to...

And the furnace says "I'm about to"

The thermostat checks the temperature again, and the loop continues

Until the temperature is a perfect 67 degrees, when it tells the furnace/boiler to stop

And the furnace says "Collaborate and listen".

And so this cycle continues until April

But not all feedback loops are equal.

# The bike-tuning feedback loop

I am a bike guy. 

When your bike starts clicking when you pedal, it often means you need to adjust your derailleurs.

And this is a derailleur. 

Maybe you don't recognize it by name, but you probably recognize it as the mechanical thingy

that changes the gears on your bike when you click a button on the handlebars.

To tune the derailleurs on your bike, there is a feedback loop.

You turn a screw a quarter turn, and then you ride the bike 20 feet to see if everything is lined up.

Bad

Here's a way to make that feedback loop awful.

The problem is, I don't see the results of this for days.

And if I get it back and find that it still doesn't shift well, I have to take it back to the shop again.

This is a loose, slow feedback loop.

Better

We can make this a little better.

It turns out my neighbor knows bikes, and he knows which screw to turn 1/4 turn. 

Here, I see the results of each tuning in a much shorter time.

But I still have to take my bike over to my neighbors house each cycle through the loop.

Best!

But we can make this even better!

I can learn a new skill - in this case, bike repair

And now, I get to see the results of each tuning almost instantly!

## So how do I get better feedback?

--

# By tightening the loop.

???
steve

The tighter the loop, the quicker the feedback/your ability to react

There are a couple of ways to do this.

One way is to make the arrows in the loop shorter.

In my bike example, it meant eliminating trips to the bike shop or neighbors house.
