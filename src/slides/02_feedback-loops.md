# Feedback Loops

# What is a feedback loop?

```
----action---->
<---effect----
```

???
Definition: blah blah blah you put an action in, see the effect, and keep doing that.

# The Thermostat

???

The canonical example of a feedback loop is a thermostat.

---

# The Thermostat

```
----adjust furnace ------------>
<--- measure air temperature----
```

???

The thermostat checks the room temperature.

If it is below the desired temperature, it tells the furnace/boiler to...

# Warm It Up Kris
---

# The Thermostat

```
----adjust furnace ------------>
<--- measure air temperature----
```

???

The thermostat checks the temperature again, and the loop continues

Until the temperature is at 67 degrees, when it tells the furnace/boiler to stop

But not all feedback loops are equal.

# The bike-tuning feedback loop

???

I am a bike guy. 

When your bike starts clicking when you pedal, it often means you need to adjust your derailleurs.

???

And this is a derailleur. 

Maybe you don't recognize it by name, but you probably recognize it as the mechanical thingy

that changes the gears on your bike when you click a button on the handlebars.

# The bike tuning feedback loop


```
---tune ----> 
<-----ride---
```

???

To tune the derailleurs on your bike, there is a feedback loop.

Simplified, it looks like this. 
 
---

# The bike tuning feedback loop

```
---turn a screw 1/4 turn ----> 
<-----ride 20 feet -----------
```

???

A little less simplified, this is the loop. 

You turn a screw a quarter turn, and then you ride the bike 20 feet to see if everything is lined up.

# The bike tuning feedback loop

```
----- tune ----------->v (at the bike shop)
^                      v
^                      v
^<-----ride------------- 
```

???

Bad

Here's a way to make that feedback loop awful.

The problem is, I don't see the results of this for days.

And if I get it back and find that it still doesn't shift well, I have to take it back to the shop again.

This is a loose, slow feedback loop.

---

# The bike tuning feedback loop

```
----- tune ----->v (at my neighbor's house)
^                v
^<-----ride------- 
```

???

Better

We can make this a little better.

It turns out my neighbor knows bikes, and he knows which screw to turn 1/4 turn. 

Here, I see the results of each tuning in a much shorter time.

But I still have to take my bike over to my neighbors house each cycle through the loop. 

---

# The bike tuning feedback loop

```
---tune ----> (in my driveway)
<-----ride---
```

???

Best!

But we can make this even better!

I can learn a new skill - in this case, bike repair

And now, I get to see the results of each tuning almost instantly!

## So how do I get better feedback?

--

# By tightening the loop.

???

The tighter the loop, the quicker the feedback/your ability to react

There are a couple of ways to do this.

---

# Tightening the Loop

```
----- tune ----------->v (at the bike shop)
^                      v
^                      v
^<-----ride------------- 
animate this to go from bigger to smaller.
```

???

One way is to make the arrows in the loop shorter.

In my bike example, it meant eliminating trips to the bike shop or neighbors house.

---

# Tightening the Loop

```
---A ---- B ----- C -->v 
^                      v
^                      v
^<-- F --- E ---- D ---- 
animate this to go from more stops to fewer stops.
```

???

Another way is to eliminate steps.

(maybe ditch this slide)

# The Developer-QE feedback loop

```
^code ----> build ---> deploy ---v
^<---- changes <---- test <------v
```

???

So let's take a look at a feedback loop we experience daily.

This is the loop between developers and QE's.

There are a lot of stops along that loop.

A lot of opportunities for that loop to get bigger, and slower.

Tyler and I want to help you make that loop smaller, instead.
